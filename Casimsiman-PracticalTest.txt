	<p>Hi! I am Aliza Marie M. Casimsiman. This is my first published page on my website. First, to get to know me better, I would like to introduce my family. I have a twin sister, a younger brother, and my mom and dad. My dad was working on abroad, and my mom was a housewife. I am 18 years old; the same goes for my twin sister, and a younger brother who is 16 years old. My mom was 57 years old, turning 58 this year. She is a martial law baby. And my dad was a baby boomer, and he is 56 years old. <br><br>
	I am very thankful because I had the best family in the world. They are caring and reassuring. My parents are supportive of my passion. They are my inspiration and the reason why I keep fighting against every obstacle. Whenever there are challenges, my family does not take them as negative, so I have this attitude of being optimistic. I want to finish my studies and get a job soon to give them a comfortable life where my father does not need to work abroad. My parents are a loving people and are lovable. I had a sibling who shared the same vibes with me. We share the same music taste and fashion tastes. I am happy and thankful for all I have and are given to me.<br><br>
	And of course, I will never forget to share these fur babies. We had two cats. I considered them my youngest sibling. More like, they’re babies in the family. Their names are Baki(left) and Rakku(right). They are my stress relievers. Both are sweet, lovable, and one of the greatest blessings that appeared in our family.

		</tr>
	</table>
	<br><br>
</p>
<p>
	I had a colossal family, so I never thought my life was boring. Thanks to them, I enjoyed my life to the fullest. And that is all about it! I hope you enjoyed reading my story. I won’t make it long since there will be a next time! Goodbye!
